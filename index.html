                        I am currently a student at the University of Akron.  I am studying computer science, 
                        programming, and web development.  I have played soccer my entire life and I also try 
                        to golf frequently.  In some of my other free time, I mess around with python and program 
                        raspberry pis to do cool things.
                        <br><br>
                        Fun fact: my brother taught me how to solve a rubik's cube and now I can solve the 2x2, 3x3, 
                        4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 cubes.  My dad and I also solved the 10x10 cube, but it takes a couple hours 
                        and I don't want to sit there that long...
